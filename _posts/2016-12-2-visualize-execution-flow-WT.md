title: Visualizing the execution flow from DINAMITE traces

Our [earlier post](/2016-11-12-tech-reports/) explained how to compile the
WiredTiger key-value store using DINAMITE and how to generate the traces
of executed functions. In this post, we will explain how you can obtain
a high-level summary of what happened during the execution using our trace
analysis tools.
